It is built on top of the NumPy library and provides a host of functionalities that extend beyond NumPy's capabilities. The name \"SciPy\" also refers specifically to the central library within this ecosystem, which is used for high-level computations.\n\n\nThe **scipy.stats** module is a significant part of the SciPy library, dedicated to statistical functions and algorithms.\n\n- Diverse Distributions: The module provides tools to work with a wide range of probability distributions, both continuous and discrete. This includes standard distributions like normal, uniform, binomial, poisson, and many more specialized ones.\n\n- Statistical Functions: Functions for computing statistics are available, such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation. It also provides functions for more advanced statistical tests, like t-tests, ANOVA, chi-squared tests, and correlation coefficients.\n\n- Random Sampling and Data Generation: Tools to generate random samples from various distributions, which can be particularly useful for simulations or generating synthetic data.\n\n- Statistical Utilities: Functions for tasks like histogram creation, data transformation, and kernel density estimation.\n\n**We will use functions available in scipy.stats module to understand the qualititve behavior of the most common PDFs/PMFs**","metadata":{}},{"id":"63e1fb90","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Binomial Distribution\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for the Binomial distribution is:\n$ P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $\nwhere:\n- $ n $ is the number of trials.\n- $ p $ is the probability of success in any given trial.\n- $ k $ is the number of successes.\n\n\n**Variance and Standard Deviation for Binomial function**\n\nVariance ($ \\sigma^2 $):\n$ \\sigma^2 = n \\times p \\times (1-p) $\n\nStandard Deviation ($ \\sigma $):\n$ \\sigma = \\sqrt{n \\times p \\times (1-p)} $\n\nComment: The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.

These numbers can be integers or floats, depending on your needs.\n\n- Reproducibility with Seeds: NumPy allows setting a 'seed' for its random number generator. By using the same seed, you can reproduce the same sequence of random numbers, which is invaluable for debugging or sharing results with others.\n\n- Random Sampling: NumPy provides functions to randomly sample from arrays, which can be used for bootstrapping or other resampling techniques.\n\n## Basic Usage Examples:","metadata":{}},{"id":"2b2ad4f1","cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing the necessary module\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Seed for Reproducibility ---\n# Setting a seed ensures that the random numbers are reproducible.
