These Z bosons, once produced, instantaneously decay into a pair of leptons. Leptons are detected and meausured by a collider detector. In this exercise, five properties of the lepton is measured: energy (E), the three spatial components of its momentum px, py, pz, and the electric charge of lepton (+1 meaning positively charged, -1 meaning negatively charged). In the csv label, the first line is a header indicating the meaning of entries. E1, px1, py1, pz1, and Q1, are the energy, px, py, pz, and charge of lepton1, respectively; similarly, E2, px2, py2, pz2, and Q2 are properties of lepton2. Each line in the csv file corresponds to a collision event. In each collision event, only one Z boson was produced.  \n\n\nYou will `reconstruct` the properties of the original Z boson using measured lepton properties. We will use the conservation of energy and momentum of the physical system. Since the two leptons are products of the Z boson decay, the energy of the physical system comprised of the two leptons should be the same the energy of the Z boson. The same can be said about the momenta of the Z boson and the di-lepton system. We have the following relations:\n\n$Z \\rightarrow l^{+}l^{-}$\n\n$E_Z = E_1 + E_2$\n\n$\\vec{p_Z} = \\vec{p_1} + \\vec{p_2}$ where $\\vec{p_1}$ and $\\vec{p_2}$ are the momenta of the lepton 1 and lepton2, respectively. \n\nEnergy and momentum have the following relation\n\n$E^{2} = m^{2} + |\\vec{p}|^2$\n\n(here we use natural units https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units#Natural_units_(particle_and_atomic_physics) in practice, mass, energy, and momentum are treated as quantitites with the same dimension.) \n\n\nWhat these equations tell you is that you can use the measured energies and momenta of leptons to derive the original Z boson energy and momentum. Then, the Z boson mass can be calculated from its energy and momentum.\n\n#### Useful relations\n\n   - mass $m = \\sqrt{E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2}$ . Note that $|\\vec{p}|^2$ is simply $p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2} + p_{z}^{2}$\n   - transverse momentum $p_{T} = \\sqrt{p_{x}^2 + p_{y}^{2}} $ . $p_{T}$ is the projection of the particle momentum to the x-y plane (in particle physics, known as the `transverse plane`). We'll use p_T for transverse momentum for simplicity.\n   - the polar angle of the particle $\\theta = arccos(p_z / |\\vec{p}|) $ \n   - the azmuthal angle of the particle: \n       - $\\phi = arccos(p_x/p_T)$ if $p_y > 0$\n       - $\\phi = 2\\pi - arccos(p_x/p_T)$ if $p_y < 0$\n   - the pseudorapidty of the particle $\\eta = log_{e}(tan\\frac{\\theta}{2})$\n\n**Also check out the sketch below**\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://portal.nersc.gov/project/m3438/physics77/week6/coordinate_system.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n</div>\n\n\nNote that in this exercise and the homework03, we use the terms \"lepton\" and \"muon\" interchangeably.

One of the experiments recognized by this year's Nobel Prize in Physics was conducted in 1971 by Berkeley physicists Stuart Freedman and John Clauser, and the latter won the Nobel Prize this year. Prof. Freedman taught at UC Berkeley and passed away in 2012. Their pioneering work was published by Phys. Rev. Letters (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.28.938) and it was also the Ph.D. project of Stuart Freedman, who at the time was a graduate student at our department. Check out this news article about Freedman and Clauser's experiment at Berkeley https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/10/04/physics-nobel-recognizes-berkeley-experiment-on-spooky-action-at-a-distance/\n\nIn this exercise, we will reproduce the most important figure in Freedman and Clauser's 1971 paper (often colloquially knonw as the \"money plot\"), with matplotlib. We will also pratice some numpy operation and making ratio and residual plots.\n\n\nThe plot shown below is the Figure 3 of Freedman and Clauser's paper (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.28.938). It shows the R($\\phi$), the coincidence rate for two photon detection, as a function of the angle $\\phi$ between the planes of photon linear polarization. While you are encouraged to read their paper for details of the experiment, here you do not have to know the underlying physics to complete this exercise.\n\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://portal.nersc.gov/project/m3438/physics77/week6/originalFreedman.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Description of the exercise\nI used an online data digitizer to obtain the data points and curve from Figure 3 of Freedman and Clauser's seminal paper (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.28.938).

The two cells below load data from these files and plot the measurements and prediction on the same figure. \n\nYour task is to use the code I developed to replcate the ATLAS $H \\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ mass plot as a reference, to reproduce the plot attached here. You can find my example code in the notebook of Lecture 5, released on October 3, 2022.\n\n- specifically, you need to produce a plot with a ratio panel and a plot with a residual panel.\n\n- **your plot should have the same axis labels, line and marker styles, legend, colors, text labels, lines, etc. as my examples shown below.**\n\n- to get the prediction values at the nine angular points where measurements were made, you can load the data from `QM prediction at nine measured points.csv`.
