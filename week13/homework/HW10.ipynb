    "## Problem 1: Hermite Interpolation of a Robotic Arm's Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-dimensional robotic arm moves along the x-axis. Its position and velocity at certain time instants are known:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At \\( t = 0 \\) seconds, the arm is at position \\( x(0) = 0 \\) units with a velocity \\( v(0) = 0 \\) units/second.\n",
    "- At \\( t = 10 \\) seconds, the arm has moved to position \\( x(10) = 10 \\) units and has a velocity \\( v(10) = 0 \\) units/second.\n",
    "- At \\( t = 20 \\) seconds, the arm returns to position \\( x(20) = 0 \\) units and slows down to a stop with a velocity \\( v(20) = 0 \\) units/second.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hermite Interpolation**: Define the Hermite interpolation polynomial for the given data points and their corresponding velocities. (10 pt)\n",
    "2. **Visualization**: Plot the motion $x(t) $ of the robotic arm over the given time interval. Ensure the given data points are highlighted on the plot. (20 pt)\n",
    "3. **Visualization of the time derivative** Plot the velocity of the robotic arm over the given time interval. The velocity in this one-dimensional problem is simply the first time derivative of the position $x(t)$. (20 pt)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember that Hermite interpolation accounts for both the function values and their derivatives at the specified points.\n",
    "- Utilize relevant libraries or tools to aid in constructing the polynomial and plotting. Specifically, you should read the documentation of the CubicHermiteSpline and understand how to use it \n",
